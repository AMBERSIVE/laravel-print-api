# PDF Printer

[![Maintainability](https://api.codeclimate.com/v1/badges/ed7345b2d07919087ba4/maintainability)](https://codeclimate.com/github/AMBERSIVE/laravel-print-api/maintainability)

This package is a wrapper for the [PRINT-API](https://github.com/AMBERSIVE/print-api) from [AMBERSIVE KG](https://ambersive.com). This package requires this endpoint otherwise you will not be able to create any pdf document.

## Installation

```bash
composer require ambersive/pdfprinter
```

## Usage

Please be aware that you will need a running instance of the [PRINT-API](https://github.com/AMBERSIVE/print-api). Otherwise the methods won't work as expected.

```php
// Setup the pdf printer
$printer  = new PdfPrinter($settings);
$printer->create("http://localhost:8080/pdf")->save("folder");
```

The full possiblities

```php
// Setup the pdf printer
$settings = new PdfPrinterSetting("http://localhost", 3000);
$printer  = new PdfPrinter($settings);
$options  = new PdfPrinterOption(
    $filename, 
    $postBackUrl,
    [], //$postBackBody 
    "" // $token
);

// Set auth header for basic authentication
$username = "test";
$password = "asdf";
$printer->authBasic($username, $password);

// Set auth header for basic authentication
$printer->authBearer("CUSTOM OR JWT TOKEN");

$printer->create("http://127.0.0.1:8000", null, function($instance, $result, $options, $successful) {
    // Will be executed after print execution
})->save('test', null, function($instance, $result, $filename, $path, $successful){
    // Do stuff after storing (even called if store was not successful)
});
```

## How to create beautiful documents
While this package is a connection between the print server and your laravel application (so it's a helper method), we also created a package [document-viewer](https://github.com/AMBERSIVE/laravel-document-viewer) which will help you to create printable documents. The document viewer will help you to define the required routes for getting and uploading the files. And it will even give you a smooth way to delare "Printables".
